        <p>It's important to go to your appointment unless you or someone you live with has <a href="javascript:void(0);">symptoms of COVID-19</a>.</p>
        <p>Some people who've had the COVID-19 vaccine may get swollen glands in their armpit or neck for a few days, which may be found during screening. Tell them when you book your appointment if youâ€™ve had a COVID-19 vaccine within the past 5 days.</p>
        <p>Contact your GP surgery as soon as possible online or by phone if you think you may have<a href="javascript:void(0);">symptoms of breast cancer</a>.</p>
        <p>All NHS services are making sure it's safe for you to attend.</p>
