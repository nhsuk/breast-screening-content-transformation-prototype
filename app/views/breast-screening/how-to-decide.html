      </h1>

      <section>
        <p>Regular breast screening is one of the best ways to spot a cancer that is too small to feel or see.</p>
        <h2>What breast screening is</h2>
        <p>Breast screening uses a special X-ray, called a mammogram, to check your breasts for signs of cancer.</p>
        <p>It's done by female health specialists called mammographers.</p>
        <p>Anyone registered with a GP as female with automatically be invited by post when it's time to go for screening. It's offered every 3 years between the age of 50 until you turn 71.</p>
        <p>Some trans and non-binary people should have breast screening, though they may not be invited automatically.</p>

        <h2>Who can get breast cancer</h2>
        <p>Anyone can get <a href="/breast-cancer-in-women-overview">breast cancer</a>.</p>
        <p>It is the most common type of cancer in the UK.</p>
        <p>The chance of getting breast cancer increases as you get older. Most breast cancers are diagnosed in women over 50 years old.</p>
        <p>Men, including trans me who've had top surgery, can also get breast cancer.</p>

        <h2>How breast screening can help</h2>
        <p>Breast screening saves around 1,300 lives each year in the UK.</p>
        <p>It can find breast cancer before you notice any signs or symptoms.</p>
        <p>Finding cancer early can make it:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>more likely that treatment will be successful</li>
          <li>less likely you’ll need to have a breast removed (<a href="javascript:void(0)">mastectomy</a>).</li>
          <li>more likely you’ll be cured</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can have breast screening whatever size or shape your breasts are.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Risks of breast screening</h2>
        <p>The main risk of breast screening is finding and treating a cancer this is not life-threatening.</p>
        <p>Doctors cannot always tell if a cancer will go on to be life-threatening or not. So treatment is always offered with a breast cancer diagnosis.</p>
        <p>Other risks of breast screening include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>radiation from X-rays – having a mammogram every 3 years gives you a slightly higher chance of getting cancer over your lifetime</li>
          <li>worry or anxiety from having to have extra tests – most women who need further tests will not have breast cancer</li>
          <li>a cancer being missed – mammograms do not always find a cancer that is there</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most people feel the benefits of breast screening outweigh the possible risks.</p>
