        <p>The mammograms are done by a female health specialist (mammographer). The mammograms should take around 15 minutes. The whole appointment should take about 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>Before starting, the mammographer will check your details with you and ask if you have had any breast problems.</p>
        <p>They will also explain what will happen during the screening and answer any questions you have.</p>

        <h2>How breast screening is done</h2>
        <p>Breast screening is usually done by 1 or 2 mammographers. You can ask them about any questions or concerns you have.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>You’ll need to undress, in a changing area, so you are naked to the waist. You may be given a hospital gown to put on.</li>
          <li>You’ll be called into the X-ray room and the mammographer will explain what will happen.</li>
          <li>The mammographer will place your breast onto the X-ray machine. It will be flattened between 2 pieces of plastic to keep it still while the X-rays are taken. This takes a few seconds.</li>
          <li>The X-ray machine will then be tilted to one side and the process will be repeated on the side of your breast.</li>
          <li>Your other breast will be X-rayed in the same way.</li>
          <li>You will then return to the changing area to get dressed.</li>
        </ol>

          </h3>
          <p>Breast screening is often uncomfortable and sometimes painful for some people.</p>
          <p>You can talk to the mammographer, who is trained to help you feel more comfortable and give you support. You can also ask to stop at any time.</p>

      </section>

      <section>
      <h2>Breast screening if you are trans or non-binary</h2>
      <p>If you have not had top surgery (chest reconstruction) and wear a binder, you will need to remove this before having a mammogram.</p>
      <p>Private changing areas are available, so you can remove your binder just before the mammogram.</p>
      <p>If you have any worries or questions you can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>talk to your local breast screening service - <a href="javascript:void(0);">find breast screening services</a></li>
        <li>contact the <a href="javascript:void(0);">Macmillan Cancer Support support line</a></li>
        <li>bring someone with you to your appointment</li>
      </ul>

        <p>Any physical discomfort or pain you may have during a mammogram should go away very soon.</p>
        <p>If you found the mammogram very painful you may have pain for a couple of days. This will go away but see a GP if it does not.</p>
