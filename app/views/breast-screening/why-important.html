        Breast screening (mammogram)
      </span>
      <p><b>Regular breast screening is one of the best ways to spot cancer that is too small to feel or see.</b></p>
      <p>Breast screening is recommednded every 3 years in women over 50 as breast cancer is more common as you get older.</p>

        <h2>How breast screening can help</h2>
        <p>Breast screening saves around 1,300 lives each year in the UK.</p>
        <p>It uses a special breast X-ray called a mammogram to find cancer before you notice any signs or symptoms.</p>
        <p>Finding cancer early can make it:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>more likely that treatment will be successful</li>
          <li>less likely you’ll need to have a breast removed <a href="javascript:void(0);">(mastectomy)</a></li>
          <li>more likely you’ll be cured</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It’s important you know how your breasts normally look and feel even if you have mammograms every 3 years. Cancers can develop between mammograms.</p>

        <h2>Who can get breast cancer</h2>
        <p>Anyone can get breast cancer.</p>
        <p>It's the most common type of cancer in the UK.</p>
        <p>The chance of getting breast cancer increases as you get older. Most breast cancers are diagnosed in women over 50 years old.</p>
        <p>Men, including trans me who've had top surgery, can also get breast cancer.</p>
        <p>Read more about <a href="javascript:void(0);">breast cancer in men</a>.</p>
        <h3>People with a higher chance of getting breast cancer</h3>
        <p>You may have a higher chance of getting breast cancer if you have:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>several close relatives who have had breast or ovarian cancer or both</li>
          <li>you have a change in a gene (mutation) that makes you more likely to get breast cancer – these can include BRCA1, BRCA2 or TP53</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You might be told you have a moderate or high risk of getting breast cancer.</p>
        <div class="nhsuk-inset-text">
          <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Information: </span>
          <p>Speak to a GP if you think you might have a higher chance of getting breast cancer.</p>
          <p>They can refer you to a genetic specialist who will talk to you about your risk. You may need to have genetic tests.</p>
        </div>
          <p>If you have a higher chance of getting breast cancer you may:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>be invited for breast screening before you are 50</li>
            <li>be invited more often than every 3 years</li>
            <li>have MRI scans as well as mammograms – MRI can give a clearer picture in younger people</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The genetic or cancer specialists looking after you will explain how you will be screened.</p>

       <h2>Breast screening is a choice</h2>
       <p>It’s your choice if you want to go for breast screening. Screening does not stop you getting breast cancer, but it is the best way to spot cancers at an early stage.</p>
       <p>If you do not want to be invited for screening, contact a GP or your local breast screening unit and ask to be taken off the breast screening list.</p>
       <p>You can ask them to put you back on the list at any time if you change your mind.</p>

      <h3>Risks of breast screening</h3>
      <p>The main risk of breast screening is finding and treating a cancer this is not life-threatening. This is known as over-diagnosis and over-treatment.</p>
      <p>Doctors cannot always tell if a cancer will go on to be life-threatening or not. So treatment is always offered with a breast cancer diagnosis.</p>
      <p>Other risks of breast screening include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>radiation from X-rays – having a mammogram every 3 years gives you a slightly higher chance of getting cancer over your lifetime</li>
        <li>worry or anxiety from having to have extra tests – most women who need further tests will not have breast cancer</li>
        <li>a cancer being missed – mammograms do not always find a cancer that is there</li>
        <li>finding the mammogram uncomfortable</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Most people feel the benefits of breast screening outweigh the possible risks.</p>
