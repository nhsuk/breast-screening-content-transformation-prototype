        <p>You will usually get your results within 2 weeks of your breast screening appointment. They will be sent to you by letter.</p>
        <p>They will also be sent to the GP surgery you are registered with.</p>
        <p>Rarely you may need to have another mammogram to get a clearer picture of your breasts. Your results would be sent after this second breast screening appointment.</p>

          <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Information: </span>
          <p>Try not to worry if it takes longer to get your results letter. You can call the GP surgery or breast screening unit to see if they have any updates.</p>
          <p>It does not mean anything is wrong, and most people will have a normal result.</p>

        <h2>What your results mean</h2>
        <h3>No sign of breast cancer</h3>
        <p>Your letter may say that your mammogram shows no sign of breast cancer.</p>
        <p>You will not need any further tests and will be invited again in 3 years.</p>
        <p>Most people who have breast screening will have no sign of cancer.</p>
        <h3>Need further tests</h3>
        <p>Your results may say that your mammogram looks abnormal. You will be asked to come for more tests.</p>
        <p>These can include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>an examination of your breast</li>
          <li>more mammograms</li>
          <li>ultrasound scans of your breast</li>
          <li>taking a small sample (biopsy from your breast using a needle</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You will usually get your results within 1 week.</p>
        <p>You may feel anxious about having further tests and what this means.</p>
        <p>Most people who need further tests will not be diagnosed with breast cancer.</p>
        <p>But if there are signs of breast cancer, finding it early means treatment is more likely to be successful and it's less likely you’ll need to have a breast removed (<a href="">mastectomy</a>).</p>
