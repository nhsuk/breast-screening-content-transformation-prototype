        <h2>Things to tell the team when you book</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>have a disability</li>
          <li>have problems with your mobility – wheelchair access is available at most centres and some mobile units</li>
          <li>have breast implants – you may need an extra X-ray to get a clearer picture around the implant</li>
          <li>are pregnant, think you could be pregnant or are breastfeeding</li>
          <li>are under the care of a breast consultant</li>
          <li>have had a mammogram in the last 6 months</li>
          <li>need an interpreter if your first language is not English</li>
          <li>have had a coronavirus vaccine within the past 5 days – some people may have swollen glands in their armpit which can be picked up by the X-rays</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can have breast screening whatever size or shape your breasts are. </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Booking if you are trans or non-binary</h2>

          <li>were assigned female at birth and have not had surgery to remove your breasts and male chest reconstruction (top surgery)</li>
          <li>were assigned male at birth and have been talking feminising hormones for longer than 2 years</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you are registered with a GP as a man, you may not be invited automatically.</p>
